        <h1>Proffesional communication</h1>
        <p>I have learn how one have to behave in the workplace how to
             proffesionally communicate eith your fellow colleguegs and customers
            the difference in traditional values of other people or tribes
        the assingments we were given during the year were very
         interesting and educational at the same time communication
          has to be my favourate because i'm always interested in learning more about
        about other peoples culture norms and beliefs bcause if you know and understand those
    you can set boundaries of what and how do you adress everything with them  </p>
        <h1>Programming</h1> 
        <p>I have always enjoyed programming as it is challenging and teaching
             me new things all the time things that i even didn't know they exist and human can do
            like coding i thought computers do codes for themselves
             but found out in programming how these works
             I enjoy playing with codes trying to make them function every now and then
             first term wasn't easy with the suedocode assignments and having to practice
             farmiliarise myself with coding and evrything but managed
              to pull myself together and serve
              learning from HTML,CSS,Javascript and more have been exciting
               and educational as i kept learning more and more and i'm also fine with my marks
            </p>
        <h1>Business</h1>  
        <p>I have learnt that business module is very imoportant more especially in my field of study
            as one might attempt to become an entreprenuer it is very important
             to understand and equipt yourself with all aspects of business
             The business module was not a walk in the park at all first term
              but i improved as time goes by i did good in this current term
               from my task or projects of business proporsalwhich i've done good
                in it thought me of where i am heading towards
                Business module was was challenging and educational one had to have so much confidence in herself
